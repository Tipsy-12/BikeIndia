# BikeIndia

### Introduction
   
- Problem Statement: BikeIndia, a US-based bike-sharing service provider, experienced a significant drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company aims to forecast the demand for bike-sharing services post-pandemic to optimize its operations and boost profitability.

- Objective: The project seeks to identify the significant factors affecting bike demand and
develop a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict daily bike rentals based on these factors.

- Business Goal: The model will help BikeIndia understand how various factors influence bike
demand, enabling them to adjust their business strategy to meet customer needs and maximize
revenue in a recovering market.

### Data Understanding

Dataset Description: The dataset contains daily bike rental counts along with various
features that may influence demand, such as:

- Datetime: Date and time of the record.
- Season: Categorical variable (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).
- Holiday: Binary variable indicating if the day is a holiday.
- Workingday: Binary variable indicating if the day is a working day.
- Weather: Categorical variable representing weather conditions.
- Temperature: The temperature in Celsius.
- Humidity: The relative humidity.
- Windspeed: The wind speed in km/h.
- Count: The target variable representing the number of bikes rented.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Missing Values: There was no missing data in either rows or columns.
- Duplicate Rows: There were no duplicate rows.
- Outlier Treatment: Any detected outliers in the dataset were handled appropriately.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visual Analysis:

- Correlation Matrix: Show correlations between features and the target variable to identify
key predictors.
- Distribution Plots: Analyze the distribution of important features like temperature, humidity,
and their relationship with bike rental counts.
- Seasonal Trends: Examine the impact of different seasons on bike rental counts.
- Weather Impact: Assess how different weather conditions affect the demand.

Key Insights:

- Seasonality and weather are expected to significantly impact bike rental demand.
- Working days and holidays likely influence the number of rentals.

### Feature Engineering

Transformation:

- Datetime Features: The date and time are split into more granular features (e.g., hour, day,
month) to better capture temporal patterns.
- Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features like season and weather into
dummy variables for modelling.
- Normalization: The features are normalized or standardized to ensure that all variables
contribute equally to the model.

### Model Building

- Model Selection: A Multiple Linear Regression model is selected due to its simplicity and
interpretability for predicting the continuous target variable (bike rental count).
- Model Implementation: The notebook explains the step-by-step process of building the
model, including feature selection and handling multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor
(VIF).
- Model Evaluation:
- Metrics: Evaluate the model using R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, Mean Absolute Error
(MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Cross-Validation: If applicable, the notebook might use cross-validation to ensure the
modelâ€™s robustness.
- Model Interpretation: Coefficients are analyzed to understand the impact of each feature on
bike rental demand.

### Results and Discussion

- Model Performance: The model's predictions are compared with actual rental counts. A
detailed discussion on the accuracy and reliability of the model's predictions is included.
- Residual Analysis: The notebook might include a residual analysis to check for any patterns
that the model fails to capture.
- Significant Features: The most influential features are identified and discussed, providing
insights into which factors most strongly drive bike demand.

- Limitations: The report should acknowledge the limitations of the model, such as potential
biases, overfitting, or the assumption of linearity.

### Conclusion

- Summary: The report summarizes the key findings, emphasizing how well the model
performs and the insights gained from the analysis.
- Business Implications: The model's results can guide BikeIndia in making informed
decisions to manage bike inventory, pricing strategies,
